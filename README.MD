# Calculator API

This is a simple calculator API made using python and flask. It was made to
practice the basics of API construction. It supports four operations:
* Addition
* Multiplication
* Division
* Subtraction  

Each operation class is designed to respond only  to JSON post requests with two parameters, x
and y, each with a numerical value.
